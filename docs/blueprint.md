# **App Name**: CephAI Studio

## Core Features:

- Image Upload: Upload radiographic headfilms (cephalograms) in standard image formats (e.g., PNG, JPG, DICOM).
- Interactive Display: Display the uploaded cephalometric image with zoom and pan functionalities.
- Automatic Landmark Detection: AI-powered automatic detection of cephalometric landmarks. The tool uses an advanced model to precisely identify key anatomical points.
- Manual Landmark Correction: Allow manual adjustment of the detected landmarks by the user with a friendly interface.
- Automated Cephalometric Analysis: AI-powered cephalometric analysis tool. Generates a report based on the identified and corrected landmarks.
- Report Generation and Visualization: Display the analysis results in an easily readable format. Show calculated measurements, norms, and any deviations.
- Data Export: Export the cephalometric analysis report, the marked-up image, and the raw data (landmark coordinates, measurements) in standard formats (PDF, CSV, etc.).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to evoke a sense of professionalism, science, and clinical precision.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F2F5) provides a clean, neutral backdrop that reduces eye strain during extended use.
- Accent color: Muted orange (#FFAB40) to highlight important landmarks or selectable user interface elements without causing visual distraction.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font providing excellent readability and a modern feel.
- Use clear, simple icons from a consistent set (e.g., Material Design Icons) to represent common actions such as upload, save, export, and zoom. Icons should be monochromatic and adapt to the color scheme.
- Maintain a clean and well-organized layout. Use a responsive design to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Organize related functions into logical panels.
- Use subtle animations for feedback and transitions. For example, a gentle highlight on a landmark when selected, or a smooth transition between views.
